**here you go:**
I made this project to fulfill the miniproject 2 course from my college, feel free if you want to use as reference. If there is a question you can contact me.

note:
1. On ".env" file you can change the email with yours as web email for verification requirement.
2. Don't forget to install the node JS on this project, because i didn't put it in.
3. You must have php 8 or higher installed in your operating system.

Thank You..
