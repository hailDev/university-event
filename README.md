# university-event
**This is a re-create repo from my previous project "Event Management".
Because there's a error or maybe bug in the repository, I can't even cloning the repo to my local. So, I create this new repository.**

**here you go:**
I made this project to fulfill the miniproject 2 course from my college, feel free if you want to use as reference. If there is a question you can contact me.

note:
1. On ".env" file you can change the email with yours as web email for verification requirement
2. Don't forget to install the node JS on this project, because i didn't put it in

Thank You
